# Magnanelli-MarineDebrisClassification-project

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning classifier able to distinguish marine debris among a set of classes, exploiting satellite images. This is possible thanks to [MARIDA](https://github.com/marine-debris/marine-debris.github.io) dataset providing the labels and [eo-learn](https://eo-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library that act as a bridge between Python environment and Earth Observation data.
